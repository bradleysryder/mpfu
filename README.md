# MPFU
Multi-Protocol File Uploader

I am creating MPFU to learn Python. This is my first attempt at making something whole and useable (though maybe not useful). 

MPFU is cross-platform (Windows and Linux currently, macOS in the future?) and is capable of sending one or more files to multiple destination servers (from a text file or input manually) using different protocols for each connection, if desired. 

#### Features:
-**FTP, SFTP, SCP, SMB/CIFS, AWS S3 upload**
-**One-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many uploads from manual input or a list in text format**
-**Windows and Linux support**
-**Tab completion for file system paths and filenames on all platforms**
-**Pretty(?) colors**

Python 3 is required for the script version.

A Windows EXE version is available in the EXE folder. It is standalone and does not require Python or anything else to be installed.
