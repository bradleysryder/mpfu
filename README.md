# mpfu
Multi-Protocol File Uploader

I am creating MPFU to learn Python. This is my first attempt at making something whole and useable (though maybe not useful?) MPFU is capable of sending one or more files to multiple destination servers (from a text file or input manually) using different protocols for each connection, if desired. Currently FTP, SFTP, SCP, and CIFS/SMB are supported. I will likely add S3 support in the future.
